# Headley Web & SEO — headleyweb.com Rebuild

## Project Overview
Matt Headley's business website. Next.js App Router + Tailwind v4 + MDX blog.
This is both the live business site AND the proving ground for the Next.js starter kit.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 16.1.6 (App Router, `src/app/`)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 (`@tailwindcss/postcss`) — no daisyUI (removed due to class conflicts)
- **Fonts:** Fraunces (headings + decorative ampersand, `next/font/google` with `axes: ["opsz"]`) + Inter (body, `next/font/google`) + Rock Salt (accent, `next/font/google`). All fonts self-hosted via next/font — no `<link>` stylesheet tags. Playfair Display was removed — ampersand now uses Fraunces with forced `opsz: 144`.
- **Hosting:** Vercel (deploy from GitHub)
- **Analytics:** GA4 (consent-gated — build same pattern as HTML starter kit)
- **Forms:** Formspree (or Vercel serverless — TBD)
- **Blog:** MDX in `/content/blog/` (not yet set up)

## Design System: "Sage & Stone"

### Color Tokens (defined in `globals.css :root` + `@theme inline`)
| Token | Tailwind class | Hex | Usage |
|-------|---------------|-----|-------|
| `--color-primary` | `hw-primary` | `#E07B3C` | Terracotta — CTAs, accents |
| `--color-primary-dark` | `hw-primary-dark` | `#B85A24` | Button shadow, hover |
| `--color-secondary` | `hw-secondary` | `#6B8F71` | Sage — links, card glow |
| `--color-dark` | `hw-dark` | `#1C2826` | Nav, footer, dark sections |
| `--color-light` | `hw-light` | `#F5F0EB` | Body background |
| `--color-text` | `hw-text` | `#2D2D2D` | Body text |
| `--color-text-light` | `hw-text-light` | `#6B7280` | Captions, muted |
| `--color-white` | `hw-white` | `#FFFFFF` | Cards, overlays |

Use Tailwind classes: `bg-hw-primary`, `text-hw-dark`, `border-hw-secondary`, etc.

### Typography
- **Headings:** `font-family: var(--font-heading)` → Fraunces (set on h1-h6 in globals.css)
- **Body:** `font-family: var(--font-body)` → Inter (set on body in globals.css)
- **Hero:** `clamp(2.5rem, 5vw, 4rem)`
- **H2:** `clamp(1.75rem, 3vw, 2.5rem)`
- **Body:** `1.125rem` (18px)
- **Decorative Ampersand:** The `.amp` class uses Fraunces with `font-variation-settings: "opsz" 144 !important` to force the decorative high-contrast ampersand glyph at any size. Without this override, Fraunces auto-switches to a simplified ampersand below ~24px due to optical sizing. The `!important` is required because Tailwind v4 strips `font-variation-settings` without it. Playfair Display was removed — the ampersand now uses the same font family as headings.
- **Ampersand usage:** Only use the `.amp` class on brand mark instances ("Headley Web & SEO" in nav, footer). Do NOT use it in body text paragraphs — let body text ampersands render in Inter.

### Component Classes (defined in `globals.css`)
- **`.btn-primary`** — Terracotta tactile button with 3D box-shadow, press-down on hover/active
- **`.btn-secondary`** — Sage outline button, fills on hover
- **`.card-glow`** — White card with sage border-glow on hover
- **`.section-angled`** / **`.section-angled-reverse`** — Diagonal clip-path dividers
- **`.ken-burns-subtle`** / **`.ken-burns-medium`** — Slow zoom on images
- **`.animate-on-scroll`** — Fade-up on scroll (needs IntersectionObserver JS — not yet wired)

## Key Source Documents (in parent `headleyweb-rebuild/`)
- **`website-copy.md`** — ALL website copy. Pull directly into components. Don't rewrite on the fly.
- **`brandscript.md`** — StoryBrand framework, one-liner, soundbytes, brand descriptor
- **`DESIGN_BRIEF_FILLED.md`** — Locked design decisions (colors, fonts, structure, effects)
- **`PLAN.md`** — Full plan with page list, architecture, and post-launch roadmap
- **`BLOG_POST_PLAN.md`** — Planned blog content (MDX)
- **`BUSINESS_STRATEGY.md`** — Revenue model, pricing, growth plan
- **`NEXTJS_KIT_NOTES.md`** — Patterns to extract for the Next.js starter kit

## Build Rules

### Copy
- Pull ALL copy from `website-copy.md`. Never invent copy during the build.
- Hero sub-headline: "Stop losing leads to a website that isn't working for you. I build clear, mobile-friendly sites that help you get found, get calls, and get booked — for a predictable flat rate."
- Keep hero headline broad (no geo). Geo goes in JSON-LD `areaServed`, answer-first blocks, footer, trade pages.
- Don't use "StoryBrand" in hero or customer-facing headlines. Use it on About page, Services page, blog posts.

### Blog Writing Workflow
- **Voice guide:** `~/Documents/Web Development/local-legends/content/AUTHENTIC-VOICE-GUIDE.md` — same guide as Southern Legends, applies here too.
- **AI kill list applies:** No delve, foster, leverage, tapestry, "it's worth noting," tricolon groups, mirror paragraphs, summary conclusions, em dashes, semicolons in casual copy, marketing hedges, uniform paragraph lengths. See Part 5 of the voice guide.
- **AI-written posts (6):** All current published blog posts were written entirely by Claude and tagged `aiWritten: true` in frontmatter. They need Matt's review and proofing before being treated as final. Don't reference them as voice examples.
- **Draft in progress:** `drafts/why-i-build-for-local-businesses.mdx` — outline only, needs Matt's voice.

**What Matt writes from scratch:**
- Personal story posts (like the "why I build" draft)
- About page copy, trust-building sections, anything that builds credibility through vulnerability

**Where Claude can draft with heavy rewriting by Matt:**
- Tactical/educational posts ("5 things your HVAC website needs") — Claude drafts, Matt rewrites in his voice before publishing

**Where Claude can draft with light editing:**
- Meta descriptions, schema markup, technical SEO content, social copy

**When Matt removes `aiWritten: true` from a post, it's been proofed and can be treated as final/publishable.**

### Structure
- Build one page at a time. Finish and verify before starting the next.
- Build one section at a time within each page. Pause for review after each section.
- Homepage section order: Hero → Pain Points → Services → How It Works → Trust (empathy + benefit cards) → Portfolio → Pricing (Build Tiers) → Pricing (Care Plans) → Consequences → FAQ → Final CTA → Lead Gen Form → Answer-First Block (hidden/SEO)
- Every page needs: unique `<title>`, meta description, OG tags, canonical, JSON-LD

### Styling
- All styles go in `globals.css` or as Tailwind utility classes. No `<style>` blocks in components.
- Use existing component classes (`.btn-primary`, `.card-glow`, etc.) — don't recreate with raw Tailwind.
- New component classes get added to `globals.css` following the existing token pattern.

### Images
- **Always use `next/image`** — never raw `<img>` tags. ESLint `@next/next/no-img-element` is set to `error` and will fail the build.
- **Pre-optimize source files:** Save images as WebP (via `convert.py` or `cwebp -q 80`) at appropriate dimensions before adding to `/public/images/`. Next.js Image optimizes on delivery, but pre-sized WebP sources reduce first-request latency.
- `width`/`height` on every `<Image>` (or use `fill` for images that cover their container)
- Hero: `priority={true}`. Everything else lazy by default (Next.js Image default).
- Add `sizes` attribute for responsive images. Add `quality={80}` to match our WebP quality target.
- For images in a fixed-height container with `object-cover`, use `fill` + parent `position: relative`.

### SEO & AEO
- JSON-LD `LocalBusiness` schema on homepage (type: `ProfessionalService`)
- `areaServed`: Jacksonville, Anniston, Oxford, Gadsden, Centre, Talladega + Calhoun/Etowah/Cherokee/Talladega counties
- `FAQPage` schema on any page with FAQ
- `BreadcrumbList` on inner pages
- Answer-first content blocks (100-200 words) on homepage and services page — visible or `<script type="application/ld+json">`
- Brand descriptor: "Headley Web & SEO is a Jacksonville, Alabama web design studio that builds StoryBrand-powered websites for local service businesses in Northeast Alabama."

### Attribution
- HTML comment at top of layout: `<!-- Built by Headley Web & SEO | headleyweb.com -->`
- Footer: "Built by Headley Web & SEO" (this is our own site)
- `<meta name="author" content="Headley Web & SEO | headleyweb.com">`
- JSON-LD `creator` block

### Analytics & Consent
- GA4 gated behind cookie consent (same pattern as HTML starter kit, adapted to React)
- Track: `phone_click`, `form_submit`, `cta_click` events
- No tracking fires until user accepts

### Accessibility
- `prefers-reduced-motion` respected (already in globals.css)
- 4.5:1 contrast minimum on all text
- **Button contrast:** `.btn-primary` uses dark text (`--color-dark`) on bright terracotta (`--color-primary`) = 5.12:1. Hover shifts to white text on `--color-primary-dark` = 4.64:1. Never use white text on `--color-primary` (2.97:1 — fails).
- Semantic HTML: `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`
- Skip-to-content link

### Performance
- **All fonts via `next/font/google`** — self-hosted, non-render-blocking. Never use `<link rel="stylesheet">` for Google Fonts.
- **Hero image preloaded** via `<link rel="preload">` in layout.tsx `<head>`
- `.trim()` all env vars before use (Vercel trailing whitespace bug)

## Next.js Kit Notes
After completing each major component or page, update `../NEXTJS_KIT_NOTES.md` with:
- Components that proved reusable (tag with `[EXTRACT]`)
- Pain points to solve differently
Prompt the user: "Want to add anything to the Next.js kit notes?"

## Pages to Build
1. **Homepage** (`page.tsx`) — all sections from website-copy.md
2. **Services** (`services/page.tsx`) — detailed service descriptions + answer-first block
3. **About** (`about/page.tsx`) — owner story + credentials
4. **Portfolio** (`portfolio/page.tsx`) — project cards with screenshots
5. **Contact** (`contact/page.tsx`) — form + Calendly + phone
6. **Blog** (`blog/`) — MDX-powered, launch with 2 posts
7. **Privacy** (`privacy/page.tsx`)

## Audit Tool & PDF Report
- **Audit page:** `src/app/audit/page.tsx` — free site checkup, email-gated PDF report
- **PDF generator:** `src/lib/generate-report-pdf.ts` — see copy guidelines in file header
- **Messaging scorer:** `src/lib/storybrand-scorer.ts` — scores HTML structure, not visual layout
- **Copy rules for audit/PDF:**
  - Never use "StoryBrand" in customer-facing text — use "messaging," "clarity," "your website's message"
  - Don't imply Matt personally reviewed it — use "the checkup found," not "I found"
  - First-person OK for forward-looking ("What I'd Fix First") since that's what Matt will do
  - Labels must be honest about what the code actually checks — if it reads HTML, don't claim "above the fold" or "visible right away"
- **Lead funnel:** Automated PDF (step 1) → free personal follow-up by Matt (step 2, video/call/in-person)
- **Desktop PageSpeed:** `route.ts` now fetches mobile + desktop in parallel. `performanceDesktop` field added to `AuditResult`. Report PDF shows both scores side by side. Mobile is the primary number (most visitors are on phones).
- **Quick terminal audit script:** `Documents/Web Development/between-worlds/fetch-site-audit.py` — run with `python3 fetch-site-audit.py` from Claude Code for any new prospect site. Pulls meta description, JSON-LD schema, viewport/mobile signal, and both mobile + desktop PageSpeed in one shot. No API key needed (uses public PSI endpoint). Copy to each new client project folder as a starting point.
- **Competitor section (PDF report):** `generate-report-pdf.ts` has a "Who's Outranking You" section (Section 7b) that renders when `competitors[]` is passed to `buildReportDoc`. The section is fully built — styling, per-competitor blocks, advantage callouts. What is NOT built: auto-fetching competitors. The audit API scrapes the target URL and runs PageSpeed, but it does not research who's ranking for their keywords. Competitor data has to be passed in manually from wherever `buildReportDoc` is called (e.g., the quiz results page). Automating this would require either a search API (e.g., DataForSEO, SerpAPI) or hardcoded industry presets. Until then, populate `competitors[]` manually before generating the report.

## Existing Site Assets
Copy from `~/Documents/Web Development/headley-web-seo/`:
- `images/` — headshot, brand mark, project screenshots, OG image
- `lead-tracker-setup.gs` — Google Apps Script for lead tracking
